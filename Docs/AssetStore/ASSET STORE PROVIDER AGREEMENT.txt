APPENDIX 1 ASSET STORE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT 1. Parties to the Agreement/The Subject Matter of the Agreement: 1.1 This Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EULA”) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (“END-USER”) that acquires an Asset from the Unity Asset Store and either (i) Unity Technologies APS (company no. 30 71 99 13), Vendersgade 28, DK-1363 Copenhagen, Denmark (“Licensor” or "Unity"), or as the case may be (ii) any third party (“Provider”) that distributes its Assets from the Unity Asset Store. Consequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Unity or by a Provider ("Licensor"). This EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Unity and END-User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Unity), or (ii) Provider and End User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Provider). 1.2 By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, End User agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA. All definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding. 1.3 The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Asset acquired by End User from the Unity Asset Store. The Assets are licensed, not sold. 1.4 END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires an ASSET which in the Unity Asset Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Unity), then Provider shall be considered as Licensor of such Asset and, consequently, only Provider (as opposed to Unity) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that payment takes place to Unity. 2. END-USER's Rights and Obligations 2.1 END-USER may use the licensed Assets only for their intended purpose. 2.2 Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate Assets only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and interactive media and distribute such electronic game and interactive media.
